# SehhaTech

## About the project:

SehhaTech addresses the widespread shortage of healthcare staff, causing increased workload, longer patient wait times, and challenges in delivering timely healthcare services. The AI medical assistant, supporting standard Arabic and regional dialects, offers a versatile interaction through audio, text, and medical imagery. It efficiently collects patient information, generating comprehensive reports for clinicians. The system's conversational capabilities identify the needed medical specialty, suggesting suitable doctors for streamlined referrals. SehhaTech enhances healthcare efficiency, providing a personalized patient experience.
