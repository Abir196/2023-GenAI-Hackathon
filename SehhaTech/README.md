# SehhaTech

## About the project:

SehhaTech represents a multimodal AI medical assistant that supports both standard Arabic and regional dialects, allowing patients to interact using various modalities, including audio, text, and medical imagery. This experience closely replicates an interaction with an experienced healthcare provider. As a result, our solution effectively addresses the challenge of healthcare staff shortages, primarily due to its report generation system. This system comprehends patients' concerns, asks concise questions, and delivers a comprehensive report to the attending clinician, streamlining the healthcare process.
